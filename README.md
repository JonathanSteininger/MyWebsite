# MyWebsite

<h1>What the website is for</h1>
This website is meant to hold all the information an employer would want when looking into me.
such as:
<ul>
  <li>Information about me</li>
  <li>My projects</li>
  <li>My experience</li>
  <li>How to contace me</li>
  <li>general information about me</li>
</ul>

I want this to be a beacon to show what I can acomplish. I want it to impress anyone on me website.

<h1>What will the website have?</h1>

<h2>FrameWork</h2>
This website is built on the ASP.NET core framework, allowing me to create dynamic pages using c# in an MVC environment.

<h3>Identities</h3>
I will be using Identities to handle users, but I'll only have an admin account anyways.

<h3>Database</h3>
ASP.Net core allows me to easily use a database to store all the information on the webpage, and then dynamically load pages depending on the informmation iside the database.

<h3>Libraries</h3>
I will be using libraries such as bootstrap to make styling the pages way easier. 

<h2>Who is allowed to collaborate?</h2>
I am making this project for myself to show off my programming knowledge, and therefore will be making this website on my own.

I want to use this time to practice committing to github and show that I am able to use github effectivly.

Employers will probably check my github account and check how well I use it, how often I commit, and some of my big projects.

<h1>Why is this open source?</h1>

<p>
  I see no harm in letting it be open source.<br/>
  I can easily prove that I made this website, and display it as one of my projects, any vulnrabilities that come from this website being open source will just help it get more secure.<br/>
  This website wont be hosting any sensitive data, and if the database gets wiped by somehow doing an sql injection ill just have a backup anyways. :P <br/>
  this project is way more valuable if I let people that go to the webpage be able to view the source code. I also like having stuff be open source!
